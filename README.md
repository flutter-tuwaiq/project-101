## **Lists**

1. What is a List in Dart? Provide an example of when you would use a List.
2. Write a Dart code to create a list containing the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Then, add the number 5 to the list.
3. Write a Dart code to remove the first element from the list you created in question 2.
4. Write a Dart code to reverse the order of the list you created in question 2.
5. Write a Dart code to check if the number 3 is present in the list you created in question 2.


**Maps**

6. What is a Map in Dart? Provide an example of when you would use a Map.
7. Write a Dart code to create a map containing the following key-value pairs: "apple": 1, "banana": 2, "orange": 3. Then, add the key-value pair "grape": 4 to the map.
8. Write a Dart code to remove the key-value pair "apple": 1 from the map you created in question 7.
9. Write a Dart code to check if the key "orange" is present in the map you created in question 7.
10. Write a Dart code to retrieve the value associated with the key "banana" from the map you created in question 7.


## **Loops**

```dart
  List listNumber = [3,6,10,9,4,30.57.1]
```

For Loops and Lists

11. Write a Dart code to print all the elements of a given list using a for loop.
12. Write a Dart code to calculate the sum of all the elements in a given list using a for loop.
13. Write a Dart code to find the maximum element in a given list using a for loop.
14. Write a Dart code to find the minimum element in a given list using a for loop.
15. Write a Dart code to print all the even elements of a given list using a for loop.


For Loops and Maps

```dart
  Map mapNumber = {
    "keyOne":3,
    "keyOne":6,
    "keyFirst":10,
    "keySecond":9,
    "keyThird":4,
    "keyFourth":30.
    "keyFifth":57.
    "keyVI":1
  }
```

16. Write a Dart code to print all the keys in a given map using a for loop.
17. Write a Dart code to print all the values in a given map using a for loop.
18. Write a Dart code to calculate the sum of all the values in a given map using a for loop.
19. Write a Dart code to find the key associated with the maximum value in a given map using a for loop.
20. Write a Dart code to find the key associated with the minimum value in a given map using a for loop.

21. What is a List of Maps in Dart? Provide an example of when you would use a List of Maps.
22. Write a Dart code to create a List of Maps containing the following data:


```dart
[
  {"name": "Alice", "age": 25},
  {"name": "Bob", "age": 30},
  {"name": "Charlie", "age": 35}
]
```


23. Write a Dart code to print the name of each person in the List of Maps created in question 2 using a for loop.
24. Write a Dart code to print the age of each person in the List of Maps created in question 2 using a for loop.
25. Write a Dart code to find the oldest person in the List of Maps created in question 2 using a for loop.
26. Write a Dart code to find the youngest person in the List of Maps created in question 2 using a for loop.
27. Write a Dart code to add a new person to the List of Maps created in question 2. The new person should have the name "David" and age 40.
28. Write a Dart code to remove the person with the name "Charlie" from the List of Maps created in question 2.
29. Write a Dart code to sort the List of Maps created in question 2 by age in ascending order.
30. Write a Dart code to sort the List of Maps created in question 2 by name in descending order.



## **Classes, Objects, and Factory Constructors**

31. What is a class in Dart? Provide an example of when you would use a class.
32. Write a Dart code to create a class named "Person" with properties for name and age. Then, create an object of the `"Person"` class and print out its properties.
33. Write a Dart code to create a factory constructor for the `"Person"` class that takes in a Map of properties and returns an object of the `"Person"` class.

## **If Statements**

34. What is an if statement in Dart? Provide an example of when you would use an if statement.
35. Write a Dart code to check if a given number `is greater than 10` and print `"The number is greater than 10"` if it is, and `"The number is less than or equal to 10"` if it's not. Then, modify your code to also check if the `number is less than 0` and print `"The number is negative"` if it is.
36. Write a Dart code to check if a given string is `"hello"` and print `"The string is hello"` if it is, and `"The string is not hello"` if it's not. Then, modify your code to also check if the string is null and print `"The string is null"` if it is.
